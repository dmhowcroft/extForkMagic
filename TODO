TODO over of the next year ;-)

- English documentation
	we working on it, but we need help !!!!!!!
        the wikisite from Berlios are outsourced to 
	http://ext4magic.sourceforge.net/ext4magic_en.html
  Current stat 09.2014: does not look nice, but is informative   


- the development in the file-project has negative implications for the quality of the magic function
	file-5.04 ---> file-5.19 tests reached a negative recovery result of 5% and more
	ext4magic need a own privat magic database in the future
	the interface is integrated by ext4magic-0.3.2
	for first experiments http://ext4magic.sourceforge.net/magic-pattern-interface.html
 Current stat 09.2014: open


- the new Magic-function for ext3
	old 0.2.x function is very slow and inaccurate
	and is not compatible with the Magic-functions of the ext4 in 0.3.x
	a support for both file systems is complex and expensive
  Current stat 09.2014: postpone


- better support for source code and other text files
	"file" can not detect the text file type if a long comment at begin of the file
	therefore the Magic-function recovers not all
	
	shell example : for a possibility solution approach
	# file -i ext4magic.c
	ext4magic.c: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

	# sed '1,/^$/d' ext4magic.c | file -i -
	/dev/stdin: text/x-c; charset=us-ascii
  Current stat 09.2014: new libmagic version eliminated the problem.
	Changes within ext4magic therefore, not required


- ext4 : with the Magic-function it should be possible to recover also some file types
  	if the deleted file has existed with 2 to 4 extents
	the conditions and preparations are already included
	the possible individual extents are already collected in the database
	a function is needed to find out and check the correct order
  Current stat 09.2014: open


Currently known issues
- on big-endian the crtime and deleted directory entry not correct if use the
  real libfunction for read the inode.
- The modified version to read the journal inode works. BUG:#017304 ; #017304
- libmagic file-5.05 crushed some video/audio formats to postscript trash
- libmagic file-5.17 many segfaults, not usable for the magic-function of ext4magic
